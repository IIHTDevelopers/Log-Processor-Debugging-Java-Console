# Log Processor (Memory Leak Fix Example)

This project is to demonstrate how to process large log files while avoiding memory leaks and resource mis-management in Java.

## Test Criteria

- Test Passes if no memory leak or resource mis-management is there.

#### Steps to Reproduce
 
1. Compile with `mvn clean package`.
2. Run unit tests to observe failure using `mvn test`
3. Final objective is to make test case pass.
4. You can run test cases many times and refactor your code.
