# Log Processor (Memory Leak Fix Example)

This project is to demonstrate how to process large log files while avoiding memory leaks and resource mis-management in Java.

## Test Criteria

- Test Passes if no memory leak or resource mis-management is there.

#### Steps to Reproduce
 
1. Compile with `mvn clean package`.
2. Run unit tests to observe failure using `mvn test`
3. Final objective is to make test case pass.
4. You can run test cases many times and refactor your code.
5. Make sure you push the code to git before the final submission using shortcut : Cntrl + Shift + B
